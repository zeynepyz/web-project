        <h1>Favorite Moments While Riding</h1>
        <div>When we are riding with my boyfriend there is some moments that comes to my mind in the middle of the day. 
            When the golden hour is getting closer and at that time if we are on the bike and closer to the sea it's just feel like i am alive again. 
            With my boyfriend is by myside and i can look to his helmet, sometimes he even turn his head to me and look me in the eye that moments and it feels breathtaking.
            That is my fav moment. There is also somethings that i like to do like joking around or the interaction with other riders. 
            I always shake my hand to them and they returned it back. Loudly singing is my fave too because none can hear me.
